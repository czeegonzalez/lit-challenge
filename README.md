# Welcome!

## This is a technical challenge for Latinas in Tech

I decided to use CodeIgniter for a very simple reason: my windows computer has some personal business with node and I couldn't install something else than a WAMP server, LOL.

I moved the Job Data file provided to a MySQL database that's available in the webserver, but I also added a copy of it in this repo for your reference.

At first, I thought I could download the source files for bootstrap and adjust them for the project but after analyzing the figma file I realized it wasn't so complicated and decided to use SCSS compiled into a CSS file for style with bootstrap as the base via CDN

I ran out of time to make the search filters but I have a clear idea on how to make them work.

And, that's it. Thanks for the opportunity and your time :D
